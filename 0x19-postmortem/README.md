## Issue Summary

- **Duration**: 4 hours, from 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM (UTC)
- **Impact**: Affecting our web application, causing a 30% decrease in user access
- **Root Cause**: Database connection pool exhaustion due to a sudden surge in traffic

## Timeline

- **10:00 AM (UTC)**: The day was as peaceful as a library until the alarms started blaring like a rock concert.
- **10:05 AM**: The incident response team was summoned, ready for action with their capes and coffee.
- **10:15 AM**: We thought we had a network hiccup, but it turned out the internet gremlins were on vacation.
- **10:30 AM**: We waved our magic wands at the network, and it waved back - no issues there!
- **11:00 AM**: We peered into the database, but it looked as calm as a Zen master on a meditation retreat.
- **11:30 AM**: Suddenly, like a surprise party, we realized it was a traffic surge that crashed our bash!
- **12:00 PM**: The matter escalated faster than a cat meme on the internet, and we had the database wizards on the case.
- **1:30 PM**: We adjusted the database connection pool like a lifeguard at a crowded pool party.
- **2:00 PM**: Peace was restored, and the application danced its way back to normal!

## Root Cause and Resolution

The root cause of our little pool party mishap was the database connection pool. It seems our application couldn't let go of connections, hogging them like a buffet table at an all-you-can-eat restaurant. The poor connection pool was drained, and no one else could dive in!

To bring things back to normal, we tweaked the connection pool settings, so it's as inviting as a hot tub on a winter's day. Plus, we taught our app some manners, so it knows when to let go of connections.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

1. **Improved Connection Pool Management**: Our pool's got a lifeguard now, making sure connections are returned to the pool when they're done with their swim. 🏊‍♂️ (TODO: Implement a connection recycling mechanism within two weeks).

2. **Monitoring Alerts**: We've got lifeguards on duty 24/7. They'll blow the whistle when the pool's getting crowded. 🚨 (TODO: Configure additional database connection pool alerts within one week).

3. **Traffic Load Balancing**: We're bringing in traffic cops to manage the traffic - no more gridlocks in our pool! 🚦 (TODO: Investigate load balancing solutions within one month).

4. **Documentation and Training**: We're teaching our developers the art of connection release, so they know when to say goodbye. 👋 (TODO: Conduct a training session for developers within two weeks).

5. **Disaster Recovery Plan**: We're creating a super-duper emergency plan for the future because we're prepared for any surprise pool parties! 🏄‍♂️ (TODO: Create a disaster recovery plan within three months).

By making these changes, we're ready to turn any mishap into a dance-off at our database pool party. Let's keep the good times rolling, and the connections flowing! 🕺💃
