# Scaled Up Web Infrastructure

## Description

This web infrastructure represents an enhanced and expanded version of the previously described setup[here](2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure.md).In this upgraded version, all Single Points of Failure (SPOFs) have been addressed, and significant improvements have been made:

## Specifics About This Infrastructure
 + Each major component, including the web server, application server, and database servers, now resides on separate GNU/Linux servers, reducing potential points of failure and improving reliability.

 + SSL protection is maintained throughout the entire communication path, and it is not terminated at the load balancer. This ensures end-to-end encryption and enhances security.

 + To bolster security, each server's network is fortified with a firewall, providing an additional layer of protection against unauthorized access.

 + Comprehensive monitoring has been implemented, allowing continuous tracking and surveillance of each server's health and performance, enabling timely detection of any issues and proactive troubleshooting.


## Issues With This Infrastructure

 + The expansion and separation of major components onto individual servers indeed introduce additional costs and considerations for the company. Some of the potential cost-related factors are:

  - Hardware Costs: Acquiring new servers for each major component will lead to upfront hardware expenses. These include the costs of purchasing servers, storage devices, networking equipment, etc.

  - Electricity Consumption: With more servers in operation, the overall electricity consumption will increase, leading to higher ongoing operational costs.

  - Infrastructure Setup: Setting up and configuring each server with the necessary software, security measures, and network settings may require additional investments in terms of time and resources.

  - Maintenance and Support: With more servers, the maintenance and support requirements will also rise. Regular updates, monitoring, backups, and technical support services may contribute to ongoing expenses.

  - Administrative Overhead: Managing a larger infrastructure might necessitate additional human resources for server administration, adding to the company's payroll.

  - Scalability Considerations: While the infrastructure is now more scalable, future growth might still require additional investments in hardware and resources to meet the expanding demands.
It's important for the company to carefully weigh the benefits of enhanced performance, scalability, and redundancy against the increased costs associated with the expanded infrastructure. Proper planning and budgeting will be crucial to ensure that the investment in the new infrastructure aligns with the company's overall objectives and financial capacity.
